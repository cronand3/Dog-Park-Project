# Dog-Park-Project
### Sydney Smith, Jared Mohammed, Ally Cronander, Marilyn Lalrindiki
Our final notebook is called Final_Project_Notebook inside this repository
All code is included in the notebook including imports. To get the code to run, you just need the csv file downloaded. As long as you clone this repository, everything should run properly. 


### Overall group member contributions:
- Sydney- Fixed the data so it was in a readable format, which was used to produce the overall yearly scan graph. I wrote functions to create the weekly popularity graphs. I found and compared the weather data to the average weekly popularity. I created the climate popularity graph over the year, and I wrote the function that will produce the hourly popularity histogram. I contributed to both the final project notebook and the slideshow.
