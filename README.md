# Dog-Park-Project
### Sydney Smith, Jared Mohammed, Ally Cronander, Marilyn Lalrindiki
Our final notebook is called Final_Project_Notebook inside this repository
All code is included in the notebook including imports. To get the code to run, you just need the csv file downloaded. As long as you clone this repository, everything should run properly. 


### Overall group member contributions:
- Sydney- Fixed the data so it was in a readable format, which was used to produce the overall yearly scan graph. I wrote functions to create the weekly popularity graphs. I found and compared the weather data to the average weekly popularity. I created the climate popularity graph over the year, and I wrote the function that will produce the hourly popularity histogram. I contributed to both the final project notebook and the slideshow.

- Jared- helped to create a class to discover the stats for each month using multiple functions that were created by all members of the group. Also found a CSV file containing weather data for the years that we had data for in the dog-park file. then used this file to create an array that contained the proper date information with the corresponding air temperature for the day and the number of visits for the day. Then used this array to create a graph to show the correlation (or lack of) with the air temperature and visits.

- Ally- I created the Git Hub repository so that we could collaborate and easily share work. I split the data into individual years. I wrote the functions Jared utilized to create the Get_Stats class. I also wrote the beginnings of some parts of the code that we did not end up using in the final part of the code, such as pseudocode for a decision-making class. 

- Marilyn- I worked mostly on how climate affects the popularity in the dog park. I went through 2013, 2015, and 2017 and parsed through the datas to see which best fit for the dates by using the find indices function. I also helped organize the final notebook and edited the sldeshow.
